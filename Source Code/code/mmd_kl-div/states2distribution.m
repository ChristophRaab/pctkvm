function distribution = states2distribution(states, number_channels)
% STATES2DISTRIBUTION convert an array of states to a distribution.
%
%   DISTRIBUTION = STATES2DISTRIBUTION(STATES, NUMBER_CHANNELS) takes an
%   array of neural states (as given by SPIKES2STATES) and the number
%   of channels in the data, and returns an unnormalized distribution
%   over states, i.e., the histogram over all states.
%
%   example:
%   spikes = [[1,0,1,0];[0,0,1,0];[1,0,1,0];[0,0,0,0];[1,0,1,0];[0,0,1,0]];
%   disp(states2distribution(spikes2states(spikes), 4)')
%      1   0   2   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   3   0   ...
