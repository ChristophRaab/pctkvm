@article{Pan.2011,
	abstract = {Domain adaptation allows knowledge from a source domain to be transferred to a different but related target domain. Intuitively, discovering a good feature representation across domains is crucial. In this paper, we first propose to find such a representation through a new learning method, transfer component analysis (TCA), for domain adaptation. TCA tries to learn some transfer components across domains in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space using maximum mean miscrepancy. In the subspace spanned by these transfer components, data properties are preserved and data distributions in different domains are close to each other. As a result, with the new representations in this subspace, we can apply standard machine learning methods to train classifiers or regression models in the source domain for use in the target domain. Furthermore, in order to uncover the knowledge hidden in the relations between the data labels from the source and target domains, we extend TCA in a semisupervised learning setting, which encodes label information into transfer components learning. We call this extension semisupervised TCA. The main contribution of our work is that we propose a novel dimensionality reduction framework for reducing the distance between domains in a latent space for domain adaptation. We propose both unsupervised and semisupervised feature extraction approaches, which can dramatically reduce the distance between domain distributions by projecting data onto the learned transfer components. Finally, our approach can handle large datasets and naturally lead to out-of-sample generalization. The effectiveness and efficiency of our approach are verified by experiments on five toy datasets and two real-world applications: cross-domain indoor WiFi localization and cross-domain text classification.},

	abstract = {Formin homology proteins (formins) elongate actin filaments (F-actin) by continuously associating with filament tips, potentially harnessing actin-generated pushing forces. During this processive elongation, formins are predicted to rotate along the axis of the double helical F-actin structure (referred to here as helical rotation), although this has not yet been definitively shown. We demonstrated helical rotation of the formin mDia1 by single-molecule fluorescence polarization (FL(P)). FL(P) of labeled F-actin, both elongating and depolymerizing from immobilized mDia1, oscillated with a periodicity corresponding to that of the F-actin long-pitch helix, and this was not altered by actin-bound nucleotides or the actin-binding protein profilin. Thus, helical rotation is an intrinsic property of formins. To harness pushing forces from growing F-actin, formins must be anchored flexibly to cell structures.},

	abstract = {This book presents machine learning models and algorithms to address big data classification problems. Existing machine learning techniques like the decision tree (a hierarchical approach), random forest (an ensemble hierarchical approach), and deep learning (a layered approach) are highly suitable for the system that can handle such problems. This book helps readers, especially students and newcomers to the field of big data and machine learning, to gain a quick understanding of the techniques and technologies; therefore, the theory, examples, and programs (Matlab and R) presented in this book have been simplified, hardcoded, repeated, or spaced for improvements. They provide vehicles to test and understand the complicated concepts of various topics in the field. It is expected that the readers adopt these programs to experiment with the examples, and then modify or write their own programs toward advancing their knowledge for solving more complex and challenging problems. The presentation format of this book focuses on simplicity, readability, and dependability so that both undergraduate and graduate students as well as new researchers, developers, and practitioners in this field can easily trust and grasp the concepts, and learn them effectively. It has been written to reduce the mathematical complexity and help the vast majority of readers to understand the topics and get interested in the field. This book consists of four parts, with the total of 14 chapters. The first part mainly focuses on the topics that are needed to help analyze and understand data and big data. The second part covers the topics that can explain the systems required for processing big data. The third part presents the topics required to understand and select machine learning techniques to classify big data. Finally, the fourth part concentrates on the topics that explain the scaling-up machine learning, an important solution for modern big data problems},

Then we examine the role of information theory in estimation theory, where the log-klikelihood can be identified as being an estimator of a cross-entropy. Then the basic quantities are extended to estimators, leading to criteria for estimator selection, such as Akaike criterion and its extensions. Finally we investigate the use of these concepts in Bayesian theory; the cross-entropy of the predictive distribution can be used for model selection; a cross-validation estimator of this cross-entropy is found to be equivalent to the pseudo-Bayes factor.},

@article{Chu.2016,
	abstract = {Automatic facial action unit (AU) and expression detection from videos is a long-standing problem. The problem is challenging in part because classifiers must generalize to previously unknown subjects that differ markedly in behavior and facial morphology (e.g., heavy versus delicate brows, smooth versus deeply etched wrinkles) from those on which the classifiers are trained. While some progress has been achieved through improvements in choices of features and classifiers, the challenge occasioned by individual differences among people remains. Person-specific classifiers would be a possible solution but for a paucity of training data. Sufficient training data for person-specific classifiers typically is unavailable. This paper addresses the problem of how to personalize a generic classifier without additional labels from the test subject. We propose a transductive learning method, which we refer as a Selective Transfer Machine (STM), to personalize a generic classifier by attenuating person-specific mismatches. STM achieves this effect by simultaneously learning a classifier and re-weighting the training samples that are most relevant to the test subject. We compared STM to both generic classifiers and cross-domain learning methods on four benchmarks: CK+ [44], GEMEP-FERA [67], RU-FACS [4] and GFT [57]. STM outperformed generic classifiers in all.},

@article{Chen.2009,
	abstract = {In this paper, a sparse learning algorithm, probabilistic classification vector machines (PCVMs), is proposed. We analyze relevance vector machines (RVMs) for classification problems and observe that adopting the same prior for different classes may lead to unstable solutions. In order to tackle this problem, a signed and truncated Gaussian prior is adopted over every weight in PCVMs, where the sign of prior is determined by the class label, i.e., +1 or -1. The truncated Gaussian prior not only restricts the sign of weights but also leads to a sparse estimation of weight vectors, and thus controls the complexity of the model. In PCVMs, the kernel parameters can be optimized simultaneously within the training algorithm. The performance of PCVMs is extensively evaluated on four synthetic datasets and 13 benchmark datasets using three performance metrics, error rate (ERR), area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic (AUC), and root mean squared error (RMSE). We compare PCVMs with soft-margin support vector machines (SVM(Soft)), hard-margin support vector machines (SVM(Hard)), SVM with the kernel parameters optimized by PCVMs (SVM(PCVM)), relevance vector machines (RVMs), and some other baseline classifiers. Through five replications of twofold cross-validation F test, i.e., 5 x 2 cross-validation F test, over single datasets and Friedman test with the corresponding post-hoc test to compare these algorithms over multiple datasets, we notice that PCVMs outperform other algorithms, including SVM(Soft), SVM(Hard), RVM, and SVM(PCVM), on most of the datasets under the three metrics, especially under AUC. Our results also reveal that the performance of SVM(PCVM) is slightly better than SVM(Soft), implying that the parameter optimization algorithm in PCVMs is better than cross validation in terms of performance and computational complexity. In this paper, we also discuss the superiority of PCVMs' formulation using maximum a posteriori (MAP) analysis and margin analysis, which explain the empirical success of PCVMs.},

	The book reports on advanced topics in the areas of neurorehabilitation research and practice. It focuses on new methods for interfacing the human nervous system with electronic and mechatronic systems to restore or compensate impaired neural functions. Importantly, the book merges different perspectives, such as the clinical, neurophysiological, and bioengineering ones, to promote, feed and encourage collaborations between clinicians, neuroscientists and engineers. Based on the 2016 International Conference on Neurorehabilitation (ICNR 2016) held on October 18-21, 2016, in Segovia, Spain, this book covers various aspects of neurorehabilitation research and practice, including new insights into biomechanics, brain physiology, neuroplasticity, and brain damages and diseases, as well as innovative methods and technologies for studying and/or recovering brain function, from data mining to interface technologies and neuroprosthetics. In this way, it offers a concise, yet comprehensive reference guide to neurosurgeons, rehabilitation physicians, neurologists, and bioengineers. Moreover, by highlighting current challenges in understanding brain diseases as well as in the available technologies and their implementation, the book is also expected to foster new collaborations between the different groups, thus stimulating new ideas and research directions},

	abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a new domain adaptation (DA) algorithm where the source and target domains are represented by subspaces spanned by eigenvectors. Our method seeks a domain invariant feature space by learning a mapping function which aligns the source subspace with the target one. We show that the solution of the corresponding optimization problem can be obtained in a simple closed form, leading to an extremely fast algorithm. We present two approaches to determine the only hyper-parameter in our method corresponding to the size of the subspaces. In the first approach we tune the size of subspaces using a theoretical bound on the stability of the obtained result. In the second approach, we use maximum likelihood estimation to determine the subspace size, which is particularly useful for high dimensional data. Apart from PCA, we propose a subspace creation method that outperform partial least squares (PLS) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) in domain adaptation. We test our method on various datasets and show that, despite its intrinsic simplicity, it outperforms state of the art DA methods.},

@article{Ding.2017,
	abstract = {Metric learning has attracted increasing attention due to its critical role in image analysis and classification. Conventional metric learning always assumes that the training and test data are sampled from the same or similar distribution. However, to build an effective distance metric, we need abundant supervised knowledge (i.e., side/label information), which is generally inaccessible in practice, because of the expensive labeling cost. In this paper, we develop a robust transfer metric learning (RTML) framework to effectively assist the unlabeled target learning by transferring the knowledge from the well-labeled source domain. Specifically, RTML exploits knowledge transfer to mitigate the domain shift in two directions, i.e., sample space and feature space. In the sample space, domain-wise and class-wise adaption schemes are adopted to bridge the gap of marginal and conditional distribution disparities across two domains. In the feature space, our metric is built in a marginalized denoising fashion and low-rank constraint, which make it more robust to tackle noisy data in reality. Furthermore, we design an explicit rank constraint regularizer to replace the rank minimization NP-hard problem to guide the low-rank metric learning. Experimental results on several standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed RTML by comparing it with the state-of-the-art transfer learning and metric learning algorithms.},

Although behavioral studies have demonstrated that these internal models are optimally adapted to the statistics of the environment, the neural underpinning of this adaptation is unknown. Using a Bayesian model of sensory cortical processing, we related stimulus-evoked and spontaneous neural activities to inferences and prior expectations in an internal model and predicted that they should match if the model is statistically optimal. To test this prediction, we analyzed visual cortical activity of awake ferrets during development. Similarity between spontaneous and evoked activities increased with age and was specific to responses evoked by natural scenes. This demonstrates the progressive adaptation of internal models to the statistics of natural stimuli at the neural level.},

We explain how semidefinite programming can be used to perform an approximate weighted completion of the kernel matrix that ensures positive semidefiniteness and hence Mercer's condition. In numerical experiments we apply a support vector machine to the XOR classification task based on randomly sparsified kernel matrices from a polynomial kernel of degree 2. The approximate completion algorithm leads to better generalisation and to fewer support vectors as compared to a simple spectral truncation method at the cost of considerably longer runtime. We argue that semidefinite programming provides an interesting convex optimisation framework for machine learning in general and for kernel-machines in particular.},

@article{Albert.1993,
	abstract = {A vast literature in statistics, biometrics, and econometrics is concerned with the analysis of binary and polychotomous response data. The classical approach fits a categorical response regression model using maximum likelihood, and inferences about the model are based on the associated asymptotic theory. The accuracy of classical confidence statements is questionable for small sample sizes. In this article, exact Bayesian methods for modeling categorical response data are developed using the idea of data augmentation. The general approach can be summarized as follows. The probit regression model for binary outcomes is seen to have an underlying normal regression structure on latent continuous data. Values of the latent data can be simulated from suitable truncated normal distributions. If the latent data are known, then the posterior distribution of the parameters can be computed using standard results for normal linear models. Draws from this posterior are used to sample new latent data, and the process is iterated with Gibbs sampling. This data augmentation approach provides a general framework for analyzing binary regression models. It leads to the same simplification achieved earlier for censored regression models. Under the proposed framework, the class of probit regression models can be enlarged by using mixtures of normal distributions to model the latent data. In this normal mixture class, one can investigate the sensitivity of the parameter estimates to the choice of {\dq}link function,{\dq} which relates the linear regression estimate to the fitted probabilities. In addition, this approach allows one to easily fit Bayesian hierarchical models. One specific model considered here reflects the belief that the vector of regression coefficients lies on a smaller dimension linear subspace. The methods can also be generalized to multinomial response models with J {\textgreater} 2 categories. In the ordered multinomial model, the J categories are ordered and a model is written linking the cumulative response probabilities with the linear regression structure. In the unordered multinomial model, the latent variables have a multivariate normal distribution with unknown variance-covariance matrix. For both multinomial models, the data augmentation method combined with Gibbs sampling is outlined. This approach is especially attractive for the multivariate probit model, where calculating the likelihood can be difficult.},

	abstract = {Covariate shift is a unconventional learning scenario in which training and testing data have different distributions. A general principle to solve the problem is to make the training data distribution similar to the test one, such that classifiers computed on the former generalizes well to the latter. Current approaches typically target on the sample distribution in the input space, however, for kernel-based learning methods, the algorithm performance depends directly on the geometry of the kernel-induced feature space. Motivated by this, we propose to match data distributions in the Hilbert space, which, given a pre-defined empirical kernel map, can be formulated as aligning kernel matrices across domains. In particular, to evaluate similarity of kernel matrices defined on arbitrarily different samples, the novel concept of surrogate kernel is introduced based on the Mercers theorem. Our approach caters the model adaptation specifically to kernel-based learning mechanism, and demonstrates promising results on several real-world applications.},

The scheme first transforms A to a bidiagonal matrix J, then diagonalizes J. The scheme described here is complicated but does not suffer from the computational difficulties which occasionally afflict some previously known methods. Some applications are mentioned, in particular the use of the pseudo-inverse A{\^{}}I = V$\backslash$$\backslash$Sigma {\^{}}I U{\^{}}*  to solve least squares problems in a way which dampens spurious oscillation and cancellation.},

	abstract = {For decades, researchers have attempted to provide patients with an intuitive method to control upper limb prostheses, enabling them to manipulate multiple degrees of freedom continuously and simultaneously using only simple myoelectric signals. However, such controlling schemes are still highly vulnerable to disturbances in the myoelectric signal, due to electrode shifts, posture changes, sweat, fatigue etc. Recent research has demonstrated that such robustness problems can be alleviated by rapid re-calibration of the prosthesis once a day, using only very small amounts of training data (less than one minute of training time). In this contribution, we propose such a re-calibration scheme for a pattern recognition controller based on transfer learning. In a pilot study with able-bodied subjects we demonstrate that high controller accuracy can be re-obtained after strong electrode shift, even for simultaneous movements in multiple degrees of freedom.},

@article{Kourou.2015,
	abstract = {Abstract Cancer has been characterized as a heterogeneous disease consisting of many different subtypes. The early diagnosis and prognosis of a cancer type have become a necessity in cancer research, as it can facilitate the subsequent clinical management of patients. The importance of classifying cancer patients into high or low risk groups has led many research teams, from the biomedical and the bioinformatics field, to study the application of machine learning (ML) methods. Therefore, these techniques have been utilized as an aim to model the progression and treatment of cancerous conditions. In addition, the ability of 5ML6 tools to detect key features from complex datasets reveals their importance. A variety of these techniques, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Bayesian Networks (BNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Decision Trees (DTs) have been widely applied in cancer research for the development of predictive models, resulting in effective and accurate decision making. Even though it is evident that the use of 5ML6 methods can improve our understanding of cancer progression, an appropriate level of validation is needed in order for these methods to be considered in the everyday clinical practice. In this work, we present a review of recent 5ML6 approaches employed in the modeling of cancer progression. The predictive models discussed here are based on various supervised 5ML6 techniques as well as on different input features and data samples. Given the growing trend on the application of 5ML6 methods in cancer research, we present here the most recent publications that employ these techniques as an aim to model cancer risk or patient outcomes.},
