** Repository for the Masterthesis Integration of transfer learning into the Probabilistic Classification Vector Machine

This repository contains source code and latex sources. The folder Thesis contains the latex sources for compiling the thesis. The folder Source Code contains the MatLab files.

The folder Source Code is divided in three subfolders.

* The folder code contains the MatLab files for the PCKTVM and every other Transfer Learning solutions which is used in the study:
    * PCTKVM
    * PCTKVM_ThetaEst
    * PCVM 
    * SVM (LibSVM)
    * TKL
    * TCA
    * JDA
    * GFK
